Project Part 1 -- Controller, that sends control signals to Datapath. (No output signals. Without control signals output).
- Be able to demonstrate a FSM that performs state transitions for appropriate processor instructions. 
- You do not need to create any output signals. (Note that this should be less difficult than the first part of lab 6). 
- You must draw your FSM and it must match the drawing.
