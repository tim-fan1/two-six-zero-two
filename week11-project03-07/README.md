Project Part 3 -- Datapath, that receives control signals from Controller.
- You can demonstrate that using control signals, you can load data from an external input data to a register, using the shared bus. 
- The control signals should be provided by a testbench (so you do not need a FSM for this stage). 
- You only need a bus, an input signal and one register. You must draw your datapath and it must match the drawing.

Project Part 4 -- Datapath, that receives control signals from Controller.
- You can demonstrate that you can perform load, move and add instructions. 
- Once again, the control signals should be provided by a testbench. Here you only need a bus, an input signal and two registers.

Project Part 5 -- Integration.
- Show your FSM and Datapath can work together to execute a simple program that is specified in your testbench

Project Part 6 -- Four operations in simulation.

- Show basic operations work

Project Part 7 -- Processor consists of at least 8 16-bit registers
