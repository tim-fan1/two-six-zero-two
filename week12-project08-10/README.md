Project Part 8 -- Can access instruction memory and execute a basic program with program counter

Project Part 9 -- Works on FPGA

Project Part 10 -- Micro Report

- To allow you to focus on implementation, the report is simplified to a Hierarchical Datapath Diagram with brief description and FSM State diagram with brief description. You will use this to describe how your circuit works to your lab demonstrator in Week 13. It should be 1-2 pages max. It is assessed during your lab session.
