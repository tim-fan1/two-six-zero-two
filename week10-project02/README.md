Project Part 2 -- Controller, that sends control signals to Datapath. (Yes control signals. With control signals output.)
- Add output logic to your FSM above to create relevant register enable signals and bus control signals. 
- You must be able to explain to a demonstrator what these signals are meant to do (they do not necessarily have to be correct, but at least along the correct lines). (Again, this
should be not much more difficult than lab 6). 
- You must draw your FSM and it must match the drawing.
